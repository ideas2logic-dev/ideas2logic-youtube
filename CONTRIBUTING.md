## 🐛 Reporting Mistakes or Issues

Found a mistake but don’t want to edit the files?

> Just open a GitHub Issue with:
- What’s wrong (e.g., typo, wrong JS behavior)
- The video title or script name
- A suggested fix (optional)

**Example**:

**Title:** Typo in tip-02 null vs undefined

**Issue:** Script says "null is an object" — should be "typeof null is 'object', but it's not actually an object."

**Suggested Fix:** Add clarification.
